# KeyVis

## Intuition and Motivation

Password Memorizing is tedious. There exists a number of password management tools, but they are either not flexible (e.g. only runs on desktop) or are not open source.

Our manager has the following advantages:

1. Flexible: Utilzing the web technology, KeyVis is supposed to run both on desktop and on web browsers

2. Intelligent: With built-in expert and visulization module, KeyVis is able to improve the strength of the passwords it manages

3. Open Source: We are offering all the source codes and developement documentations to the public

Our project is derived from the original KeeWeb application. Our main improvement is the expert and visulizaiton module.
